# UDISE+ Automation
RPA to automate promotion of students

This is a UiPath RPA which will ease promotion of students from one class to the next every single year. The UDISE+ platform does not allow import of CSVs or API access for promotion of students. Till the time they do, there is no other way but to enter data manually, which is a waste of effort. Hence, this automation to enter data using a CSV source file.
