# UDISE+ Automation
RPA to automate promotion of students

This is a UiPath RPA which will ease promotion of students from one class to the next every single year. The UDISE+ platform does not allow import of CSVs or API access for promotion of students. Till the time they do, there is no other way but to enter data manually, which is a waste of effort. Hence, this automation to enter data using a CSV source file.

You will need to enter CAPTCHA manually.

The Automation will match the student name and enter the relevant data into data fields.

Installation and running:
- Install UiPath Studio Community Edition
- Download the files in this repo
- Configure path for the source CSV
- Put in login credentials
- Open the project.json file in UiPath Studio
- Publish the automation
- Run the automation using UiPath Assistant
